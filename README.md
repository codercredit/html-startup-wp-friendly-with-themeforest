## Getting Started / Installation

### Install dependencies:

```
npm i

or

yarn
```

## Usage

```
npm run watch

or

yarn run watch
```

This task copies all the files necessary for the project to the "dev" directory and will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS, JS, PHP changes; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically reload page with injected the changes!

npm run build

or

yarn run build
```
